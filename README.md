# Mobile Contacts Management App (Java Console Application)
This is my first Java console application project, designed to simulate a mobile contact management system.
It supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing mobile contacts using an in-memory database-like structure.

# Features
Insert new mobile contacts (First Name, Last Name, Phone Number)
 
Update existing contacts by ID

 Find a contact by ID or Phone Number

Delete a contact by ID or Phone Number

 View all stored contacts

 Validation for input fields (phone uniqueness, non-empty fields)

 Service and DAO layers for clean architecture

 Exception handling for better reliability
